# Rock-paper-scissors pokemon version
#### Created by Khoa Thien Le (Harry) using Java + Processing graphic.

#### ***Usage***
- Since excutable jar file is not availble yet, game can only be run in Eclipse for now.
- Just a fun version of classic rock-paper-scissors, two players take turn to choose a pokemon from the three starter pokemons: Bulbasaur < Charmander < Squirtle (< Bulbasaur). < indicates the pokemon on the left would lose to the pokemon on the right.

#### ***Bugs/features to be fixed***
- Re-organize the code and make it more structural.
- Add more pokemons.
